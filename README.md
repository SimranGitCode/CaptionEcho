#  Caption Echo

**Caption Echo** is an image caption generator that takes an image and generates a human-like sentence describing it. It combines deep learning models from computer vision and natural language processing to understand and narrate visual content.

✨ In addition to generating captions, **Caption Echo** also supports:
-  **Sound feature** – The generated caption can be spoken aloud using text-to-speech.
-  **Translation** – Captions can be translated into any language.
-  **Multi-language speech** – After translation, the system can also read the translated caption aloud.

This makes Caption Echo a great tool for accessibility, language learning, and creative applications.

##  Features

-  Upload any image and get a descriptive caption.
-  Uses CNN for image feature extraction.
-  LSTM or Transformer model for generating captions.
-  Optional text-to-speech (TTS) feature to read captions aloud.
-  Simple and clean web interface built with Flask.

##  How It Works

1. The image is uploaded via the web interface.
2. A pre-trained CNN (e.g., InceptionV3 or VGG16) extracts features from the image.
3. These features are passed into a language model to generate a caption.
4. The caption is shown to the user, and optionally spoken aloud using TTS.

##  Future Improvements

- Support for multiple language captions
- Enhanced UI with drag-and-drop image upload
- Audio download feature
- Deploy to the web with Gradio or Streamlit
